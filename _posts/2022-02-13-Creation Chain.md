# Creation Chain

We consume more things than we probably realize. We consume not just goods but also information and knowledge. When we consume things, someone else gets paid to create those things. The higher up you are in the creation chain, the more influence you have.

Technology makes it a lot easier for people to create now. The form is no longer limited to physical goods. It can be service or information. Being a creator is the ultimate way to create wealth. Yet, even with all these luring traits, most of us end up becoming net consumers because creating is hard.

It is hard because it entails imagination and clarity. To gain clarity, you need to process information beyond surface values, see things others do not see and draw connections others dismiss. You don't have to come up with brand new ideas all the time. But you have to form your convictions and stand behind them. You also cannot rely on momentum to push through. You have to be intentional and know what you are doing every step of the way.

Creation is an active activity for your brain. In contrast, consumption is a passive activity hence much easier. Think about the difference between listening to speeches vs. giving one. As long as you have an above-average level of attention span, you can probably do the previous activity for hours. But when giving a speech, even 5 mins is enough to make you sweat. Similarly, reading is a form of consumption. You are consuming information rather than generating one. That's why reading does not equal learning. It does not necessarily translate to growth unless you can apply what you read to real-world use cases and generate values.

The higher up you are in the creation chain, the more mental capacity it demands. When you are low in the chain, you generate values by implementing other people's ideas. You are paid to work, not to think. To create more value and create more impacts, you want to be close to the source of creativity. That's where you get to lead and steer. That's how you can expand capacity and push boundaries. You are less judged by your ability to do a certain type of work but more by how well you think and create when you are in that position. You get rewarded a lot if you can do it right, rightfully so.
