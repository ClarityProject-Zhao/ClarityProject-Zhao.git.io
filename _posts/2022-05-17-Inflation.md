# Inflation

Inflation is almost a buzzword these days. What is inflation? And why does it matter?

Think about making the same amount of money but find out your favorite restaurant is charging a higher price for every dish you like. You can no longer afford to visit them as often as you used to. In other words, your real purchasing power is declining despite making the same amount of money on paper. That's inflation.

Inflation by itself is not bad. In fact, a low inflation rate is what's needed for an economy to grow. Central banks target a low inflation rate, 2%, in most cases to avoid deflation, i.e., negative inflation. Deflation is when you anticipate prices to drop day by day. In that case, people are incentivized to save and spend in the future rather than today, causing the economy to contract. This is what Japan has experienced in the past decade. Deflation tends to be chronic and perpetuates a stagnant economy.

But elevated inflation is not good either. And that's what we are experiencing today. What are the causes?

There are different mechanisms to induce high inflation. First is the so-called demand-driven inflation. This happens when people feel richer and start buying more things. When demands increase too fast for the supply to catch up, prices have to increase to balance things out.

Then there is the so-called supply-driven inflation. In this case, higher inflation is caused by the higher input costs, including raw material costs and labor costs faced by the businesses. Businesses respond either by cutting their production or passing the costs to customers directly via higher prices. Both channels will push up inflation.

There is a third factor in place, i.e., the expected inflation from people. If people expect high inflation to persist, they will demand higher wages in their economic roles as an employee and spend more money in their economic roles as a consumer (since the value of money is expected to get even lower the longer you hold), making the situation even worse both from the supply side and the demand side.

All these factors are in play in today's environment. That's why it is very hard to predict how high the inflation will eventually go and how long it will last. There are a lot of debates around which factors are more important. No matter which side you are on, one thing is for sure: central banks, with their ultra-easy monetary policies, contributed to today's high inflation, and now they are determined to put a brake on the rise.

Remember, the Fed printed a lot of money in 2020. When there is a lot of money floating around, every dollar becomes less valuable. Thatâ€™s inflation.

Specifically, of all the extra money created in the last few years, some got spent, which drove up goods demand and directly contributed to the inflation. Even for the portion that was saved or invested, while it did not find its way directly into the real economy directly, it made people feel wealthier and encouraged more people to quit their jobs. This then led to the so-called 'Great Resigntion' and resulted in the labor shortage and wage growth.

In the Fed's view (and also my view), the current inflation is a result of the economy running too hot, which is evident in the historically low unemployment rate. What Fed is trying to do now is to temper the heat by discouraging further expansion from a business standpoint. Interest rates play an important role in borrowing and budgeting. As rising rates increase borrowing costs, businesses have to be more mindful of how they spend money and invest in projects, eventually rolling over business capacity and labor demand.

The Fed believes it can engineer a soft-landing, in which scenario the demand for labor will come down just enough to meet the current labor supply at a healthy level. It is hard. Economic data is rarely precise and on time. That's why a data-driven central bank tends to overshoot, and most of the rate hikes in the past resulted in a hard landing, causing the employment rate to dip and the economy to slide.

It's hard to predict how high the inflation will go and how long the inflation will persist. As central banks anchor their current policies on inflation, it is therefore also hard to foresee the rate hike path with a high conviction. What's more difficult to predict is how the financial markets would react. Markets tend to lead the economy, with asset prices reflecting investors' expectations of the economy. What we have experienced this year so far, i.e., the severe sell-off in both bond markets and equity markets can be seen as investor's pricing in the expectation of central banks raising rates aggressively this year. What markets haven't agreed on is whether the tighter financial conditions will lead to a global recession. Earning forecasts still show above-trend growth for the rest of the year, and few economists are forecasting a recession at the macro level. But will the market see a recession eventually? Inflation is not going to peak anytime soon, and the Fed is set for a rate hike path. As we get deeper into the rate hike cycle, where the economy lands and what the market anticipates will be instrumental in deciding the direction of the market in the next chapter.
