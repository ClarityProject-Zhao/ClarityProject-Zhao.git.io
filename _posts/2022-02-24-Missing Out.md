# Missing Out

You are in an enviable position if you can afford to miss out.

Missing out means saying no to things. Saying no can be anxious when you haven't figured out what you truly want yet and are still exploring new ideas. Being able to willingly and confidently forgo potential opportunities means you are content with what you have. You probably have already discovered your place in life and would rather cave in, exploit and hone your craft.

You also have to afford it financially. A lot of projects these days require people to stay up to speed to meet the latest demand. News cycles are getting shorter, and as a result, most deliveries have a shorter shelf life. People who deliver this kind of project cannot miss out because their subjects' freshness matters. On the contrary, if your work focuses on longer-horizon projects that try to deliver 'ever-green' outcomes, then you don't have to worry about the latest trend that much.

The latter type of work can be both mentally satisfying and draining. To seek long-term truth, you need to cut through the short-term noise. You want to stay away from the crowd rather than join the crowd. This contrarian mentality requires immense mental discipline hence demanding. But it is also rewarding exactly because the work anchors on truth rather than the opinions of others. It is more about finding what matters for the future rather than simply what people are paying attention to right now.

Unfortunately, most of the jobs we do fall under the first category. Even as an investor, I find a large part of my job is related to gauging the latest sentiment. The second type is rare. People who successfully morph their careers in that direction are blessed and wise.

You may find your life quality improves due to selectively missing out. Most of the new hot trends feed on people's attention and opinions which can die out quickly. Trying to make sense of every one of them as they occur is nearly impossible and a waste of time and energy. On the other hand, if you can simply wait a little bit, the noise will run its course and fade away, and you will have a better chance of being presented with the truth. Missing out does not mean reduction. Quite to the opposite, you might find yourself doing net addition to your life by swapping opinions with facts and noise with the truth.
