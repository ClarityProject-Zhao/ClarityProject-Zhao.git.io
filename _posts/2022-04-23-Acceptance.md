# Acceptance

A lot of times, I struggle with the thoughts of ‘what if’. What if I moved abroad at a young age? What if I studied social science in college? What if I did not work in finance?

I used to talk myself off these thoughts believing they were not productive thoughts that could help me move forward. I even criticized myself for not being grateful enough for my current situation.

Over time, I learned to look at my thoughts from a different lens: these thoughts may not be productive, but they still deserve their space. Underpinning these ‘what if’s are no illusions that we can go back and change what has happened but intertwined emotions such as sorrow, remorse, curiosity, and hope: sorrow of our ephemeral life, remorse of not figuring out certain things earlier, curiosity of the various possibilities, and hope of the next chapter. They are telling a story of mine.

The self-validation has brought tremendous peacefulness to my life. Deep down, we all want to be validated. The desire is so strong that we search for it in all possible places, including the wrong ones: our peers, the authority, and even the strangers on the street. The efforts backfire when we fail to get the validation in the form we want: we deny ourselves feeling like a fluke. The acceptance of our thoughts, on the contrary, is a way of saying we are legit no matter what.

It also takes the ego off the equation. Who are we to judge a thought right or wrong? The old wisdom teaches us that life is about being ‘effortless’. At its core, being effortless means accepting where we are and who we are; it means surrendering to the flow rather than fighting against the tide at our ignorant but stubborn wills. Life is less about having to be somewhere and look in a certain way; life is simply being, and we don’t have to always try so hard.
