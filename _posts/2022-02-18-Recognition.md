# Recognition

The essence of networking is winning trust by adding value. If you are an expert in a specific field, you can add value by bringing something unique to the table. But you also want to get recognized for your expertise. That's how you win trust.

Many hard-working people overemphasize the expertise part but overlook the recognition part. They think credibility will naturally follow as long as they do good work. It may, but not necessarily. And even when it does happen, you have no control over when and how. To the extent that there is a whole industry developed around discovering talents, your odds or not bad. But just because someone may come and pick you up does not mean there is nothing you can do to speed up that process.

To get recognized, you need a stage. And what type of stage will largely decide what kind of recognition you get. To get recognized as a top athlete, you want to compete in a world championship. To get recognized as a good actor, you want to be a part of the Hollywood production.

Some people get handed a stage by being in the right place at the right time. That's called luck. And you probably don't want to count on that. What you can count on is being proactive. Being proactive helps you discover more stages and even create your stage.

Being proactive entails an outward mindset. Most critically, you want to be willing to share. You build your audience by sharing your work. If you don't feel comfortable doing this, you need to ask yourself why. Are you holding back because you don't care? Or because you don't think you are ready? Or because you are just lazy?

If you don't care and want to keep your work to yourself, that's fine. But you need to understand what you are giving up and own your decision. If you find yourself telling people that you don't care but end up complaining all the time about not getting what you think you deserve, then you are probably not as 'zen' as you think you are.

If you are the second type, you need to examine why you think you are not ready? Is it because you don't feel proud of your work, or is it because you don't think you are good enough and are afraid to get criticized? If you are not proud of what you are doing, you probably want to spend some time reevaluating your purpose and figuring out what type of work feels true to you. However, if it is more because of your imposter syndrome, you need to find a way to get out of your head. Try to convince yourself that the only way to grow is to put yourself out there and get feedback.

You can also fall under the third category. And in that case, you probably want to work on improving your execution ability first. Being lazy is usually not an attribute but a result of not having good habits. There is a whole universe of books focusing on changing habits. I recommend James Clearâ€™s Atomic Habits.

Most of the time, once you cross the bridge and feel ready to share your work, you will naturally start noticing more opportunities for you to show your work. In psychology, this is called the red car syndrome. You don't usually see a lot of red cars on the road. But if you get one yourself, you start seeing red cars everywhere. The truth is, our brains process a lot of information every second. But most of them get thrown away because our brains don't see them as important. But if you recalibrate your brain to pay attention to certain things, you will receive stronger signals every time they happen. You will start noticing opportunities to gain recognition, including small things like speaking up in a meeting or participating in an event. You will find promises in projects that do not yield immediate returns, like building your social media presence. The magic happens when you start paying attention. 

You also want to be as open-minded as you can when selecting your stage and audience. You don't want to say 'yes' to everything. But you also don't want to dismiss people based on some simple superficial metric. Embrace a variety of stages and audiences to share what you have got.
