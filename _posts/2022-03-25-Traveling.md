# Traveling

There was a period when I traveled extensively across Europe. I worked full-time but spent almost all my awakening hours either planning for the trip or hitting the road. As I organized my life around traveling, traveling felt even more full-time than my actual job.

Traveling is ridiculously refreshing. In spite of the miscellaneous one needs to cut through, the unexpected that one can expect, and the inconvenience one will experience, all these hindrances are trivialized by the moments when your dreamed destinations transform from plain pictures on the screen to real-life grandeur. Whether it is the witness of natural wonders or the contact with a new culture, traveling amazes me, humbles me, and invigorates me by showing how many possibilities there can be by simply allowing ourselves to wander.

Travelling is also meditative. So much of what we do in our day-to-day is based on auto-piloting. We spend most of our time running around like a rat spinning the wheel rather than moving forward. Traveling sets us back to the hyper-awareness mode. All our sensors get turned back on when sinking into a new environment. We observe and absorb diligently to build new reflexes and adapt to the new environment. We worry less about the future or the past and start to realize more joy by savoring the present moments.

Travelling is highly addictive. Part of me feels like traveling full-time, but the other part understands other priorities and purposes I need to fulfill. The mismatch in the number of places remaining on my bucket list and my opportunities to check them out accentuates the contrast between the unlimitedness of options we can make and the limitless of our time. We cannot have it all, and traveling crystalizes the importance of making the right choice and pursuing worthy goals.

Discovering my passion for traveling was an important chapter of my life. However, despite all the lessons I learned from traveling, it also became obvious that traveling on its own cannot solve real problems. Traveling is not a magic wand that can easily wave all the trouble away, but a beam of light that lifts the shadow from our life: it helps us see the alternatives, be aware of the present, and tune in to the urgency of life.

I am now at a stage in life where I no longer travel as frequently. While I can still relive those heart-melting sensations by recalling the moments of wonder, I have also learned to tap into my inner world to source that power. Rewardingly, the more I lean into the inner world, the less external stimuli I have to rely on to feel rejuvenized. 

Having this flexibility is comforting and empowering. The experience of traveling is not guaranteed, but our inner world will company us no matter the outside conditions. Similarly, you don't need to feel jealous of those who get to travel. Learn to recoil to the expansiveness of your consciousness and search inward, and you will find boundless joy and wisdom from within.
